### Hi‚ùï

I have private repos for medical instruments interfacing for the following machines

|Provider| Model |  Connection
|--|--|--|
| Sysmex |XP-300| TCP/IP Uni-direction
|Sysmex |CS-2500|TCP/IP Bi-direction
| Abbott |ARCHITECT |TCP/IP Bi-direction
| Abbott |Cell-Dyn |TCP/IP Uni-direction
| Beckman Coluter  | Access2 |TCP/IP Bi-direction
| Beckman Coluter | DxH500 |TCP/IP Bi-direction
| Beckman Coluter | DxH800 |TCP/IP Bi-direction
| Beckman Coluter | **AU480** |TCP/IP Bi-direction
| Stago | Compact Max |TCP/IP Bi-direction

The tools aren't for sale and only available to nonprofit healthcare providers please DM me on Twitter to have access (an attempt to fight monopolism in this field ü§î). They are open-source, written in C# using .Net Framework 4.7 with GUI. The driver app has four monitoring screens for connection status, in/out messages, recent events and parsed ASTM data.
